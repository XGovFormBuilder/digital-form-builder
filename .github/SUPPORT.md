## Resources

Before asking a question, consult the following resources

- [README.md](/README.md) for general information about the project, and how to get started

## Questions

Ask questions in a way that helps us help you. Spend time framing questions and add links and resources. Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run. Here are some tips:

- Don’t fall for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
  - In short, tell us about the problem first before the attempted solution. There may be existing solutions. Please also remember XGovFormBuilder is not a fully bespoke system. There may be existing solutions which may not be exactly what you are expecting but will still meet user needs
- Try to define what you need help with:
  - Is there something in particular you want to do?
  - What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  - Is there a concept you don’t understand?
- Provide a code sample, example form JSON that demonstrates the problem or video

You can ask questions by

- opening an issue on GitHub
