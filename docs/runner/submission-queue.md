# Submission queue

The runner can be configured to add new submissions to a queue and, if using the MYSQL queue type, for this queue to be
processed by the submitter module.

Two queue types are currently allowed, MYSQL and PGBOSS.

For `MYSQL`, enabling the queue service this will change the webhook process, so that the runner will push the
submission to a
specified database, and will await a response from the submitter for a few seconds before returning the success screen
to the user.

For `PGBOSS`, which handles events and queues as expected from event based architecture. The `PGBOSS` queue type
uses [pg-boss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-boss).
You must have a postgres v11 database configured. The runner will add job to the queue. It will then
request `${queueReferenceApiUrl}/${jobId}`
for the reference number you wish to return to the user. You must implement this endpoint yourself.

In future, we may add support for different types of queues, like SQS.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Decide if event or message based architecture is the right approach for your service, and if you have the digital
capability to support it in your organisation.
You may need queuing if your service expects high volume of submissions, but your webhook endpoints or further
downstream endpoints change frequently or have slow response times.

You will need to set up a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

Use `PGBOSS` and PostgreSQL for higher availability and features like exponential backoff.
It is highly recommended you use `PGBOSS` and PostgreSQL. MYSQL may be deprecated due to the additional overhead and
support that is required.

#### PGBOSS Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL database >=v11
- A worker process which can connect to the PostgreSQL database
- An API endpoint with a GET request `${queueReferenceApiUrl}/${jobId}`,
  e.g. `localhost:9000/reference/d28a4e85-b7d4-4983-bf0d-9c93b05e342d`
  - The `jobId` is generated when a users' submission is successfully inserted into the queue
  - The API endpoint should respond with application/json `{ "reference": "FCDO-3252" }`

#### MYSQL Prerequisites

- MySQL database

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ENABLE_QUEUE_SERVICE           | Whether the queue service is enabled or not                                                                | `false` |                                             |
| QUEUE_DATABASE_TYPE            | PGBOSS or MYSQL                                                                                            |         |                                             |

| QUEUE_REFERENCE_API_URL        | Required if you are using the PGBOSS queue type. It must return a users' reference number, based on job id |         | password                                    |
| QUEUE_SERVICE_POLLING_INTERVAL | The amount of time, in milliseconds, between poll requests for updates from the database                   | 500     |                                             |

Webhooks can be configured so that the submitter only attempts to post to the webhook URL once.

```.json
{
  "outputs": [
    {
      "type": "webhook",
      "name": "api",
      "outputConfiguration": {
        "url":"â€œhttps://api:9000",
        "allowRetry": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Running locally

To use the submission queue locally, you will need to have a running instance of a database, the runner, and the
submitter. The easiest way to do this is by using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file.

In that file, you will see the following lines commented out:

```yaml
#      - ENABLE_QUEUE_SERVICE=true
#      - QUEUE_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:root@mysql:3306/queue
#      - DEBUG="prisma*"
```

```yaml
#  if using MYSQL, uncomment submitter
#  submitter:
#    image: digital-form-builder-submitter
#    build:
#      context: .
#      dockerfile: ./submitter/Dockerfile
#    ports:
#      - "9000:9000"
#    environment:
#      - PORT=9000
#      - QUEUE_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:root@mysql:3306/queue
#      - QUEUE_POLLING_INTERVAL=5000
#      - DEBUG="prisma*"
#    command: yarn submitter start
#    depends_on:
#      mysql:
#        condition: service_healthy
#  mysql:
#    container_name: mysql
#    image: "mysql:latest"
#    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
#    ports:
#      - "3306:3306"
#    environment:
#      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
#      MYSQL_DATABASE: queue
#    healthcheck:
#      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
#      timeout: 20s
#      retries: 10

# use psql if you want a PostgreSQL based queue (recommended)
#  postgres:
#    container_name: postgres
#    image: "postgres:16"
#    ports:
#      - "5432:5432"
#    environment:
#      POSTGRES_DB: queue
#      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: root
#      POSTGRES_USER: user
```

Uncommenting the environment variables under the runner configuration will enable the queue service, set the database
url to the url of your mysql container, and turn on debug messages for prisma (the ORM used to communicate with the
database).
Uncommenting the mysql dependency will make sure the mysql server is started before prisma starts trying to connect to
it.
Uncommenting the submitter configuration will trigger the submitter to be created, exposed on port 9000, connecting to
the mysql container, with a polling interval of 5 seconds.

Once your docker-compose file is ready, start all of your containers by using the command `docker compose up`
or `docker compose up -d` to run the containers in detached mode.

## Error codes

If sending the form submission to the queue, or polling the database for the form reference, is not successful the
following errors will be thrown:

| Tags                                        | Example                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QueueStatusService, outputRequests          | There was an issue sending the submission to the submission queue |
| QueueService, pollForRef, Row ref: [row_id] | Submission row not found                                          |

## Migration guide

If you are moving from MYSQL to PGBOSS, ensure you have a worker which will handle the jobs added to your queue. For "zero downtime",

1. Set up any new infrastructure components if necessary (e.g. database and worker)
1. Point the runner to the new components via `QUEUE_DATABASE_URL` and `QUEUE_REFERENCE_API_URL`
1. Keep the MySQL database as well as the submitter running. Do not delete these yet
1. Deploy new infrastructure components alongside the existing components

Any submissions that have previously failed, or were submitted during deployment, can continue to run and submit to your webhook endpoints.
Check the database to ensure that there are no more failed entries.

You may then safely remove the submitter, and MySQL database (if it is not used for any other purpose).
