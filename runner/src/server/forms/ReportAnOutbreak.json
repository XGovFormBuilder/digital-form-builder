This situation is\n    identified when two or more instances of Acute Respiratory Infection—which\n    could be COVID-19, Flu, or an unidentified infection—occur within a 14-day\n    period. These cases must have a probable connection to the same healthcare\n    environment, suggesting a likelihood of transmission within that setting.\n    The identification of these linked cases is a key indicator for reporting\n    and taking necessary action to manage the outbreak.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">How to Report an Acute Respiratory Outbreak</h3>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    Utilise the Care OBRA Tool for quick and effective reporting of respiratory\n    infections in care settings, including single cases of Influenza or\n    suspected COVID-19 outbreaks.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Understanding the Care OBRA Tool</h3>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    The Care OBRA Tool helps the UK Health Security Agency assess and manage\n    reported outbreaks in care settings.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    As soon as you have submitted your information into the Care OBRA Tool, you\n    will receive:\n  </p>\n  <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n    <li>\n      An automatic acknowledgement email providing you with a copy of the data\n      that you have input into the tool\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      A further automatic advice email which gives you information and advice on\n      how to manage the situation that you have reported\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    The HPT or CIC Team will also review your data to decide whether any further\n    action is required and may then provide further advice and support by\n    calling or emailing you.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Completing the Care OBRA Tool</h3>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    The Care OBRA tool is designed for efficient reporting and can be completed\n    in approximately 10 minutes. Its primary purpose is to report new outbreaks\n    of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), and it is particularly vital for\n    documenting individual cases of confirmed Influenza.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    However, there are specific scenarios where the Care OBRA tool should not be\n    used. These include:\n  </p>\n  <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--number\">\n    <li>\n      <b>Updating on Existing Outbreaks/Clusters:</b> If you have already\n      notified the Health Protection Team (HPT) or the CIC Team about an\n      outbreak or cluster, do not use the Care OBRA tool for updates on these\n      cases.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <b>Single Cases of COVID-19:</b> It's no longer necessary to report\n      individual cases of COVID-19 using the Care OBRA tool.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    It's important to adhere to these guidelines to ensure efficient and\n    accurate reporting of respiratory infections within the care setting.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    After form submission, if you receive an email that assesses your situation\n    as “High Priority” over a weekend or a bank holiday, please also call the\n    Health Protection Team (HPT) out of hours service. Otherwise, your outbreak\n    will be picked up by our team the next working day.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Contacting Health Protection Teams</h3>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    For reaching out to your local Health Protection Team (HPT), both during\n    regular hours and after hours, you can easily find the necessary contact\n    details\n    <a\n      href=\"https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team\"\n      class=\"govuk-link\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >here</a\n    >. This resource offers direct access to the information needed to get in\n    touch with the appropriate HPT in your area.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    When making a call about a High Priority Outbreak, it’s important to\n    communicate clearly to the call handler that your call is under the\n    direction of your local HPT. Additionally, ensure that you have your Care\n    OBRA reference number readily available during the call. This will\n    facilitate a more streamlined and efficient communication process, ensuring\n    that your high-priority concerns are addressed promptly and accurately.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Data Sharing and Privacy</h3>\n  <p class=\"govuk-body\">\n    Data provided may be shared with relevant health authorities as per the\n    UKHSA data sharing policy.
