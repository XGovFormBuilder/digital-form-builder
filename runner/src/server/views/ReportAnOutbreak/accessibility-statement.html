                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">

                    The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" target="_blank">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) (opens in new tab)</a>.

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 (opens in new tab)</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below
                </p>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.  
                </p>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Some page headers and subtitles are incorrectly tagged or do not correspond to their associated content. This fails WCAG success criterion 2.4.6 (headings and labels).<br />
                    There is no user interface that allows the keyboard focus indicator to be visible. This fails WCAG success criterion 2.4.7 (focus visible).<br /><br />
                    External links do not signal that they will open in a new tab, so people using a screen reader do not know that the page content is changing. This fails WCAG success criterion 4.1.3 (status changes)<br />
                    <br />
                    We plan to address these issues soon. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of accessibility regulations </h3>
                    <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">PDFs and other documents</h4>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                    The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents delivered by email. We plan to meet accessibility standards with all new PDFs or Word documents we will share.
                </p>
                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We have been testing our website with users with a variety of accessibility needs. We intend to fix the non-accessible content listed above. We keep testing our website to understand where we are non-compliant with accessibility standards. Any non-compliant components will be raised in our roadmap and improved in the coming months.
                </p>
                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
