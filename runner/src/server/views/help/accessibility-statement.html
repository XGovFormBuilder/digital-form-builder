                    This website is run by UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h1>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
                </p>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" id="wcag21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-underline">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 (opens in new tab)</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below
                </p>


                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Text appears to be a heading but is not a heading element.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Disproportionate burden</h3>
                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation and accessing information</h4>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">PDFs and other documents</h4>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                        Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Live video</h4>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
                </p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    We are currently testing our website to understand where we are non-compliant with accessibility standards. Any non-compliant components will be raised in our roadmap and improved in the coming months. 
                </p>
