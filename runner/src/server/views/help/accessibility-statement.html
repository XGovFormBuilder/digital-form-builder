                <p class="govuk-body">UKHSA is committed to making this website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Website and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. This service complies with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link" id="accessibility-guidelines">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These guidelines are the internationally recognised benchmark for building accessible websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is currently being tested to assess its accessibility standards. Any limitations, issues or risks raised will be formally assessed and improved to ensure this website meets accessibility standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website was tested on 3rd July 2023 using Wave, and we found a few alerts that are not issues
                    or risks. These
                    alerts will be formally assessed as part
                    of our ongoing assessment review. The alerts are:
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Text appears to be a heading but is not a heading element</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-heading-l">Compatibility with tools</p>
                <p>
                    This website is run by UKHSA and built on the open-source XGov Form builder. We want as many people
                    as possible to be
                    able to use this website. As
                    per the accessibility done by FCDO for XGov Form builder platform, you should be able to:
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
                        <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                        <li>View the browser in a one column format (1280px browser width and Zoom in to 400%)</li>
                        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
                        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
                        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS,
                        NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site is also designed to be compatible with the following, and it will work with any browser as
                    long as it supports
                    ES5:
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>basic operating system screen magnifiers, such as ZoomText 11</li>
                        <li>speech recognition software, such as Dragon Naturally Speaking</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website works entirely without javascript, so it should work on a website without javascript.

                <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible because of the low risk alerts raised from the wave
                assessment. The issues above will be addressed as part of our commitment to improving our websiteâ€™s accessibility
                regularly and continuously. The target date
