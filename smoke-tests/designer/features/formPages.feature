    Then the changes are reflected in the page designer

    When I choose "Add Page" from the designer menu
    And I enter the details for my page
    Then the page is added in the designer

    When I choose to delete the "First page"
    Then the "First page" is no longer visible in the designer

    Then I will see an alert warning me that I am about to leave the page

  Scenario: Confirm navigating away
    When I navigate away from the designer workspace
    And I choose confirm
    Then I will go back to my previous page
