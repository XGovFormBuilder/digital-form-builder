Feature: Start Page
  As a form designer
  I want to give my form a unique name
  So that I can edit it at a later date

  Scenario: Starting a form without entering a name displays an error
    Given I am on the form designer start page
    When I try to create a new form without entering a form name
    Then I am informed there is a problem
    And the error message "Enter form name" is displayed

  Scenario: Creating a form with a name that already exists displays an error
    Given I have previously created a form
    When I enter the name of the form again
    Then the error message "A form with this name already exists" is displayed
